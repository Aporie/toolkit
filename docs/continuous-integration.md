# Continuous integration
To check the status of the continuous integration of your project, go to [Drone](https://drone.fpfis.eu/ec-europa).

A pipeline - created and maintained by DIGIT - is applied by default. It manages the code review of the code, runs all the business tests on the repository and builds the site artifact for the deployment. Customizing this pipeline, under express approval, is possible by adding a custom .drone.yml file to the project's root folder.
