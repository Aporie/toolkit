# Setting up a project

## Getting the sourcecode

Below we explain the difference between setting up a new project and setting up
an existing project:

### New project from scratch
To instatiate a new project that will be running as a subsite you only have to execute one command which will perform multiple steps:
for you automatically.

```composer create-project openeuropa/drupal-site-template --stability=dev <dg-name>-<project-id>-reference```
